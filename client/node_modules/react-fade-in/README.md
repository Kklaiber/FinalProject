## API

### `FadeIn`

Animates its children, one by one.

> **Note**: To have children animate separately, they must be first-level children of the `<FadeIn>` component (i.e. members of its `props.children`).

#### Props

*   `delay`: Default: 50. Delay between each child's animation in milliseconds.
*   `transitionDuration`: Default: 400. Duration of each child's animation in milliseconds.

Happy fading.
