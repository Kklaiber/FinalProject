The Collective App is designed to connect users and create community via shared interests, events, and groups. It is a work-in-progress, but currently users can create a personal profile, upload profile pictures, create public and group posts, comment and like/unlike posts, create public events, signify if going, interested, or can't go to events, as well as see a list of all current users.

The Collective was developed to fulfill requirements to complete Bethel Tech's Full Stack Web Development boot camp. Our team of 5 had 6 weeks to come up with an idea and create it. We chose to use the MERN stack and began with some bootstrap code from Brad Traversy's MERN stack course (https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/). From there we heavily modified it to fit our needs. We hope you enjoy our app!
